# A Brief Introduction to Android Studio

In this course we strongly recommend using [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) as your development environment. It is the defacto IDE for Android Development, and the environment we use in all videos in the course.

Android Studio is specifically made for creating Android Apps. It is actively supported and maintained by Google. It even contains an Android emulator so that you can start creating Android Apps without needing a real device. Jamal Eason will describe a few more features which will be helpful on your journey to becoming an Android Developer.

## Installing Android Studio

You should install Android Studio now, and set it up to use either a physical Android device or an emulated phone. If you need guidance for installing Android Studio, there is a mini course with instructions for both Windows and Mac installations which will also go through how to setup an emulator and make your first Hello World app.
